				<p>
					Amos Aguilera is a 6'1", 170-pound first baseman from Fontana, CA,
					with a tall, projectable frame and room to add strength. A multi-sport
					athlete competing in basketball and wrestling, he brings athleticism,
					coordination, and toughness to the baseball field. Defensively, he has
					soft hands, solid footwork, and a strong feel for the glove, making
					him a reliable presence at first base. His short arm action leads to
					accurate throws, and with further development—particularly by driving
					through his target—he can add more velocity.
				</p>

				<p>
					At the plate, Aguilera is a right-handed hitter with a slightly open
					stance and a small leg lift trigger for timing. His rotational swing
					and strong hands generate solid bat speed, allowing him to drive the
					ball into the gaps. With further refinement—such as incorporating a
					deeper hand load and working through the ball more efficiently—he has
					the potential to unlock even greater power. His multi-sport background
					enhances his strength, agility, and competitiveness, making him a
					well-rounded athlete with significant upside as he continues to
					develop.
